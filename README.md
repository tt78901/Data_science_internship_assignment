## Required Libraries

This project relies on several Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and interactive output rendering. Below is the list of required libraries along with their purpose:

### Core Libraries
1. **`numpy`**: For numerical computations and handling multidimensional arrays.
2. **`pandas`**: To manipulate and analyze structured data in tabular format.

### Visualization Libraries
1. **`matplotlib`**: To create various types of static, animated, and interactive plots.
2. **`seaborn`**: A statistical data visualization library for advanced graphics.

### Web Development (Optional)
1. **`flask`**: A lightweight web framework for building web-based interfaces to display results.
2. **`voila`**: Converts Jupyter Notebooks into interactive dashboards or web applications.

### Notebook and Exporting
1. **`jupyter`**: To run and interact with Jupyter Notebooks in a browser.
2. **`nbconvert`**: For exporting notebooks to HTML, PDF, or other formats.
3. **`nbformat`**: To parse and work with the structure of Jupyter Notebooks.

### Additional Libraries
1. **`scikit-learn`**: For machine learning algorithms, preprocessing, and model evaluation.
2. **`requests`**: To make HTTP requests for fetching data from APIs.
